Development setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Make sure that you have a working `pretix development setup`_.

2. Clone this repository, eg to ``local/pretix-passbook``.

3. Activate the virtual environment you use for pretix development.

4. Execute ``pip install -e .`` within this directory to register this application with pretix's plugin registry.

5. Execute ``make`` within this directory to compile translations.

6. Restart your local pretix server. You can now use the plugin from this repository for your events by enabling it in
   the 'plugins' tab in the settings.


Generating Passbook keys and configuring them in pretix
-------------------------------------------------------

You can generate a key and CSR using::

    export CERT_NAME=pass-pretix
    openssl genrsa -out $CERT_NAME.key 2048
    openssl pkey -in $CERT_NAME.key -traditional > $CERT_NAME.key.pem
    openssl req -new -key $CERT_NAME.key -out $CERT_NAME.csr

You can then request a certificate using that CSR in your `Apple developer account`_. You can then convert the downloaded certificate like this::

    openssl x509 -inform der -in $CERT_NAME.cer -out $CERT_NAME.pem
    
After generating the .pem file, upload it to pretix as passbook certificate.
Make sure you have uploaded the key generated before (pass-pretix.key) and added the passbook CA of apple.
Next add your Team ID in pretix and the passbook type id. The passbook type id is your identifier, as example pass.pretix.example. The Team ID can be found under "Organizational Unit" when opening the passbook certificate, e.g. with Keychain on MacOS.  
If you have configured your private rsa key with a password you can provide it in pretix.

Click on Save.
Enjoy!
